# Session Handover Document #001
**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Branch**: `feature/memory-capture-ui`  
**Next Developer**: [Partner/Next Session]

---

## Session Summary

Built the foundation for the memory capture UI feature. Created mock data, state management, and route structure. Ready for component implementation.

---

## What Was Done ‚úÖ

### 1. Documentation & Planning
- Created `CLAUDE.md` for AI context
- Set up build log and handover structure
- Documented component breakdown from monolithic UI

### 2. State Architecture
```typescript
// Created Zustand store with:
- Navigation state (currentView, menus)
- Recording state (with interval cleanup fix)
- Family state (children, active child)
- Memory state (CRUD operations)
- Filter state (search, tags, date range)
- Persistence for user preferences
```

### 3. Mock Data Structure
```typescript
// Created comprehensive mocks:
- Children profiles (Emma, Lucas)
- Memory samples with all fields
- Milestones with AI confidence
- Tag options, weather, moods
- Analytics data
```

### 4. Route Structure
```
app/(app)/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx          # Ready for auth wrapper
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ capture/page.tsx    # Main screen (needs components)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview/page.tsx   # Dashboard (placeholder)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memories/page.tsx   # List view (placeholder)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ children/page.tsx   # Profiles (placeholder)
```

## Current State of Code üìç

### Working
- ‚úÖ Zustand store fully functional
- ‚úÖ Mock data with proper types
- ‚úÖ Route structure ready
- ‚úÖ Build runs without errors

### Not Implemented Yet
- ‚ùå No actual UI components built
- ‚ùå Pages are placeholders
- ‚ùå No recording functionality
- ‚ùå No styling applied

### Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recording interval cleanup was fixed in store
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some .txt files in lib/ (renamed to avoid conflicts)

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order) üéØ

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Create AppShell wrapper**
   ```tsx
   // components/layout/AppShell.tsx
   - Wrap all pages
   - Include TopBar
   - Include SideMenu
   ```

2. **Build RecordButton**
   ```tsx
   // components/capture/RecordButton.tsx
   - Connect to useCapture hook
   - Add touch/mouse events
   - Implement visual states
   ```

3. **Build QuickEntry**
   ```tsx
   // components/capture/QuickEntry.tsx
   - Text input with plus button
   - Connect to addMemory
   ```

### Follow-up Tasks
4. Build SideMenu navigation
5. Create ManualEntrySheet
6. Style all components with Tailwind
7. Add dashboard components
8. Test mobile responsiveness

## Technical Context üîß

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Using Zustand with persistence
const useAppStore = create(persist(
  (set, get) => ({
    // State
    // Actions
  }),
  {
    name: 'seneca-app-store',
    partialize: (state) => ({
      // Only persist UI preferences
    })
  }
))
```

### Mock Data Pattern
```typescript
// ISO strings for dates (SSR-safe)
const hoursAgo = (h: number) => 
  new Date(Date.now() - h * 3600_000).toISOString()

// Type-safe options
export const tagOptions = [...] as const satisfies ReadonlyArray<{...}>
```

### Component Pattern (to follow)
```typescript
// Use existing UI components
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

// Connect to store
const { action } = useAppStore()

// Pure components, no API calls
```

## Environment & Dependencies üì¶

### Added Dependencies
- `zustand@^5.0.7` - State management

### Required Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=       # Needed for auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=  # Needed for auth
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev    # Start development
npm install    # If dependencies are missing
```

## Design Decisions Made üí≠

1. **Zustand over Context** - Performance and simplicity
2. **Mock-first development** - Unblock UI work
3. **ISO date strings** - SSR compatibility
4. **Route groups** - Clean separation
5. **Tailwind only** - Consistency with project

---

## Questions for Next Session ‚ùì

1. Should we add Framer Motion for animations?
2. Do we need React Query for data fetching later?
3. Should manual entry be a modal or sheet?
4. How should we handle image uploads?
5. What's the offline strategy priority?

## Gotchas & Tips üí°

### Gotchas
- Recording interval needs cleanup on unmount
- Dates must be ISO strings for SSR
- Child lookup should be internal to store
- Don't use derived selectors that create new arrays

### Tips
- Use `useActiveChild()` hook for current child
- Use `useFilteredMemories()` for filtered list
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for project context
- Review `UI_REFERENCE.md` for component specs

---

# Session Handover Document #002
**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Session Duration**: ~2.5 hours  
**Branch**: `feature/memory-capture-ui`  
**Next Developer**: [Partner/Next Session]

---

## Session Summary

Successfully created all 12 core UI components using the build agent. Components are fully typed, documented, and ready for integration with the Zustand store.

---

## What Was Done ✅

### 1. Component Creation via Build Agent
- Used `react-component-extractor` agent for systematic extraction
- Created `/extracted-components` directory structure
- Built 12 production-ready components

### 2. Components Implemented
```
extracted-components/
├── capture/
│   ├── RecordButton.tsx      # Hold-to-record functionality
│   ├── QuickEntry.tsx        # Text input with plus button
│   └── ManualEntrySheet.tsx  # Detailed entry form
├── layout/
│   ├── AppShell.tsx          # Main wrapper
│   ├── TopBar.tsx            # Header navigation
│   ├── SideMenu.tsx          # Drawer navigation
│   └── ProfileMenu.tsx       # User menu
├── dashboard/
│   ├── MetricCard.tsx        # Stats display
│   ├── InsightCard.tsx       # AI insights
│   ├── MilestoneTimeline.tsx # Timeline view
│   └── ChildCard.tsx         # Child profile
├── ui/
│   └── BottomSheet.tsx       # Reusable sheet
├── index.ts                  # Central exports
└── README.md                 # Usage guide
```

### 3. Quality Standards Applied
- Full TypeScript interfaces exported
- JSDoc documentation with examples
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Touch gesture support
- Dark theme with glass morphism
- Performance optimizations

---

## Current State of Code 📍

### Working
- ✅ All components created and typed
- ✅ Components are self-contained
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Build runs without errors

### Not Integrated Yet
- ❌ Components not connected to Zustand store
- ❌ Not imported in app pages
- ❌ Mock data still hardcoded in components
- ❌ No animations implemented

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Components use placeholder handlers
- ⚠️ Some components have inline mock data
- ⚠️ Recording functionality is visual only

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order) 🎯

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Wire Components to Store**
   ```tsx
   // In RecordButton.tsx
   import { useCapture } from '@/lib/stores/useAppStore'
   // Replace mock handlers with real actions
   ```

2. **Update App Pages**
   ```tsx
   // In app/(app)/capture/page.tsx
   import { RecordButton, QuickEntry } from '@/extracted-components'
   // Build the actual capture screen
   ```

3. **Connect Navigation**
   ```tsx
   // In SideMenu.tsx
   import { useNavigation } from '@/lib/stores/useAppStore'
   // Wire up view switching
   ```

### Follow-up Tasks
4. Replace mock data with store data
5. Add loading and error states
6. Implement actual recording (Web Audio API)
7. Add animations (consider Framer Motion)
8. Test on mobile devices

## Key Files to Review 📂

### Files Created This Session
```
extracted-components/
  └── All component files (12 total)
      Each with TypeScript interfaces
      and JSDoc documentation
```

### Files to Integrate With
```
lib/stores/useAppStore.ts    # Connect components here
app/(app)/capture/page.tsx   # Use components here
app/(app)/layout.tsx         # Wrap with AppShell
```

---

## Technical Context 🔧

### Component Patterns Used
```typescript
// All components follow this structure:
interface ComponentProps {
  // Fully typed props
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ ...props }) => {
  // Implementation with JSDoc
}
```

### Styling Approach
```typescript
// Using cn() utility for conditional classes
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

className={cn(
  'base-classes',
  condition && 'conditional-classes'
)}
```

### Icons Consistency
```typescript
// All icons from Lucide React
import { IconName } from 'lucide-react'
```

---

## Environment & Dependencies 📦

### No New Dependencies
- Components use existing packages
- Lucide React for icons (already installed)
- Tailwind for styling (already configured)

### Component Requirements
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons

## Design Decisions Made 💭

1. **Separate extraction folder** - Keeps components isolated for review
2. **Feature-based organization** - Logical grouping by functionality
3. **Self-contained components** - Each works independently
4. **Comprehensive documentation** - Every component has usage examples
5. **Mobile-first approach** - Touch gestures and responsive design

---

## Questions for Next Session ❓

1. Should we add Framer Motion for animations now?
2. How should recording actually work (Web Audio API)?
3. Should ManualEntrySheet be a modal or sheet?
4. Do we need loading skeletons for dashboard cards?
5. Should we implement the ProfileMenu functionality?

---

## Gotchas & Tips 💡

### Gotchas
- Components expect certain store hooks that don't exist yet
- RecordButton needs actual audio recording implementation
- ManualEntrySheet form is complex (many fields)
- Some mock data is still hardcoded

### Tips
- Start with simple components (MetricCard, InsightCard)
- Test touch interactions on actual device
- Use the exported interfaces for type safety
- Check component README for usage examples

---

## Testing Notes 🧪

### Components to Test
- [ ] RecordButton - touch/mouse events
- [ ] QuickEntry - keyboard handling
- [ ] SideMenu - navigation state
- [ ] ManualEntrySheet - form validation
- [ ] BottomSheet - gesture dismissal

### Test Scenarios
- Hold-to-record interaction
- Text input and submission
- Navigation between views
- Child switching
- Form field interactions

## For AI Assistant (Claude)

When continuing:
1. Components are in `/extracted-components`
2. Need to be wired to Zustand store
3. Check interfaces for prop requirements
4. Use mock data from `lib/stores/mockData.ts`
5. Update app pages to use components
